# Introdcution
    
    This project was done by Hussein BALLOUK and Mouna BADOURI from DIA 2. 

    In this project we worked with the dataset Online Video Characteristics and Transcoding Time Dataset Data Set. 
Our goal was to predict the transcoding time using 20 features. We followed the standard approach where we started by exploring the data and plotting some results to understand what we're working with and then do data cleaning / feature engineering when need. The first dataset was used to get those insights and the 2nd dataset (with 168K rows) was used for the training.

# Content

 In this github you will find the following :
  
  1. The readme File explaining important requirements
  
  2. The powerpoint presentation in pdf format
  
  3. The notebook of the training and data exploration
  
  4. The files related to our API.
  
 
 In this readme, you will find the necessary modules and their respective versions, followed a quick guide as to how we did our API and how to use it.
 
 # Modules
 
 The modules you will need are the following
 
  1. Pandas
  
  2. Numpy
  
  3. Matplotlib
  
  4. Flask
  
  5. Scikit-learn version 0.21.3 -> Do a "pip install scikit-learn==0.21.3". 
    - This is **really important** since our training was done on that version (the version on our PC) and there has been some changes since that version, so installing the latest version will break our code.
  
  6. Seaborn
  
  7. Itertools
